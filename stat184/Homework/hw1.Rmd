### 0. Setting working directory
getwd()

### 1. (4 pts) Use R as a calculator to find numeric answers to the following
#### a) 
```{r}
1+2*(3+4)
# The answer is 15
```


#### b) 
```{r}
4^3+3^2
```
#### c) 
```{r}
x= (4+3)*(2+1)
y =sqrt(x)
print(y)
```


#### d) 
```{r}

a= 1+2
b= 3+4
z= a/b
z^2
```




### 2. (5 pts) Create the following sequences:

#### a)
```{r}
rep('a',4)
```

#### b)

```{r}
odd_numbers <- seq(1:100)
odd_numbers <- odd_numbers[odd_numbers %% 2 == 1]
odd_numbers

```
#### c)

```{r}
sequenceC <- c(rep(2,3), rep(3,3), rep(4,3))
sequenceC
```

#### d)
```{r}
sequenceD <- rep(c(2,3,4),2)
sequenceD
```


#### e)
```{r}
my_sequenceD <- seq(0, 1000, by = 25)
my_sequenceD
```




### 3. (2 pts) What happens when you mix types inside a vector?
##### So what R does in this case is it tries to make all elements of the same type, after looking it up I found that this process is called coercion.
```{r}
x1 <- c(1.7, "a", FALSE)
x2 <- c(TRUE, 2)
class(x1)
class(x2)

```



### 4. (6 pts) Object names:
#### Some of these are legitimate object names, others are not. For the ones that are not legitimate, say what is wrong.

##### a) essay14, This is legitimate
##### b) first-essay, this is incorrect because you can not use hyphens "-" in your object name
##### c) `MyData”, this is incorrect because you can not use quotes in your object name 
##### d) small sample, incorrect because you can not have a space in your object name 
##### e) .myData, this is correct 
##### f) sqrt(), this is incorrect because this already a function


### 5. (2 pts) Subsetting a vector

```{r}
bill <- c(46, 33, 39, 37, 46, 30, 48, 32, 49, 35, 30, 48)
tail(bill,-1)
bill[which(bill > 45)]
```
